## MSFS Mobile Companion 2.0

After the original project got abandonned by it's author, I've tasked myself with rewriting this from the ground using the current branch of SimConnect Py!

Remember this is meant to be used on a tablet or with your phone in landscape, portait mode will work, but it is not advised.

##It will run as is, but doesn't do anything nor won't crash at random intervals, this is still a very early build.

## Credits

All credits go the [mracko's](https://github.com/mracko) [MSFS Mobile Companion App]https://github.com/mracko/MSFS-Mobile-Companion-App, it inspired a lot of the project, I just put it up to date and added new features, allowing more precise control your aircraft's systems.

MSFS Mobile Companion 2.0 is based on Python [SimConnect](https://pypi.org/project/SimConnect/) project. The app uses [MobiFlight's](https://www.mobiflight.com/en/index.html) WASM Event Module and the [MSFS Python SimConnect MobiFlight Extension](https://github.com/Koseng/MSFSPythonSimConnectMobiFlightExtension) by Koseng to access additional switches and buttons which arenâ€™t accessible via standard SimConnect
