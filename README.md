## MSFS Mobile Companion 2.0

After the original project got abandonned by it's author, I've tasked myself with rewriting this from the ground using the current branch of SimConnect Py!

## Credits

All credits go the [mracko's](https://github.com/mracko) [MSFS Mobile Companion App]https://github.com/mracko/MSFS-Mobile-Companion-App, it inspired a lot of the project, I just put it up to date and added new features, allowing more precise control your aircraft's systems.

MSFS Mobile Companion 2.0 is based on Python [SimConnect](https://pypi.org/project/SimConnect/) project. The app uses [MobiFlight's](https://www.mobiflight.com/en/index.html) WASM Event Module and the [MSFS Python SimConnect MobiFlight Extension](https://github.com/Koseng/MSFSPythonSimConnectMobiFlightExtension) by Koseng to access additional switches and buttons which arenâ€™t accessible via standard SimConnect
