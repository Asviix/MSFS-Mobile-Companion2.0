## MSFS Mobile Companion 2.0

After the original project got abandonned by it's author, I've tasked myself with rewriting this from the ground using the current branch of SimConnect Py!

## Credits

MSFS Mobile Companion 2.0 is based on Python [SimConnect](https://pypi.org/project/SimConnect/) project. The app uses [MobiFlight's](https://www.mobiflight.com/en/index.html) WASM Event Module and the [MSFS Python SimConnect MobiFlight Extension](https://github.com/Koseng/MSFSPythonSimConnectMobiFlightExtension) by Koseng to access additional switches and buttons which arenâ€™t accessible via standard SimConnect.

DON'T COMPILE NOW, IT WILL NOT WORK!
